As the Lead Organizer and Licensee, I took the initiative along with an amazing team to bring TEDx to Academic City University as a way to climax my undergraduate journey. It was a representation of my growth from my first year to my final year and a testament to the impact the school had made in a short time. This vision was reflected in our theme: From Ripples to Waves: Making an Impact. Our maiden edition was a resounding success!
